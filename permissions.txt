File permissions: a simple system that allows us to manage files.
every file is labled as set of permissions. 
-rwxr-xr-x.1rootroot
directory, user, groups.
level of access permissions of files :  ie read, write and execute.
user-group-others
xxx-xxx-xxx
drwxr-xr-r

<file permissions> <user> <group>

if you execute access on a directory you can access the files. if you have write permission on directory you can create/delete files. 
linux permission only apply the directory they are set on.

change permissions:
chmod (u,g or o)
chown
chgrp
